# vim-ruby-interpolation

Simple Vim plugin for Ruby which automatically adds `{}` when you type `#` inside string.

Currently works only with double-quoted strings. Percent-literals are to be added.

Also, if [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) is used, adds new surround: `#`, which wraps target with interpolation.
